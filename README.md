##Setup
In order to get AllTube working, you need to use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    npm install
    composer install

This will download all the required dependencies.

(Note that it will download the ffmpeg binary for 64-bits Linux. If you are on another platform, you might want to specify the path to avconv/ffmpeg in your config file.)

You should also ensure that the *templates_c* folder has the right permissions:

    chmod 777 templates_c/

If your web server is Apache, you need to set the `AllowOverride` setting to `All` or `FileInfo`.

##Config

If you want to use a custom config, you need to create a config file:

    cp config.example.yml config.yml


##License

__Please use a different name and logo if you run it on a public server.__

##Other dependencies
You need [avconv](https://libav.org/avconv.html) and [rtmpdump](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/) in order to enable conversions.
If you don't want to enable conversions, you can disable it in *config.yml*.

On Debian-based systems:

    sudo apt-get install libav-tools rtmpdump

You also probably need to edit the *avconv* variable in *config.yml* so that it points to your ffmpeg/avconv binary (*/usr/bin/avconv* on Debian/Ubuntu).
